Description: # rdd
        
        rdd is a set of tools for implementing regression discontinuity designs in Python.  At present, it only allows for inputs that are pandas Series or DataFrames.
        
        ## Current Features:
        
        * Computes the Imbens-Kalyanaraman optimal bandwidth (see [this article](http://www.nber.org/papers/w14726.pdf) for details)
        * Creates a dataset containing only observations within a given bandwidth
        * Generates a reduced pandas DataFrame for graphical analysis (such as binned scatter plots) when the number of observations is large
        * Implements a sharp RDD
          * With or without user supplied controls
        
        ## Features to Come:
        
        * Tutorial of how and why to use each function
        * Tutorial on how to check rdd's statistical assumptions in Python, such as using:
          * Continuity plots
          * Density plots
          * Tests for discontinuities
          * Checking for balance and testing for random assignment (though not a requirement, it can still be a useful check)
        * A robust test file for functions
          * Add error checking/reporting in functions
        * McCrary tests
        * Fuzzy rdd implementations
